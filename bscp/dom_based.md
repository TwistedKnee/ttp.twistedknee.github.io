# DOM Based vulnerabilities notes

## Methodology

So simple easy start to DOM inspection would be to both manually search for sinks, or to use DOM Invader.

To start DOM Invader load the extension in the burp browser:

You can open DOM Invader in a tab in the developer tools in the browser:

Within here you can copy the canary to inject into parameters you have user input to, see current sinks and sources when your canary has been inputted, as well as other things. We will go over this more in details in the lab walkthroughs
