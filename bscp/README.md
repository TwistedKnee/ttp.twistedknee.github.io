# BSCP Notes

Here is where I'll start on my notes for BSCP, I'll be basing this off of what some people have already done at (https://github.com/botesjuan/Burp-Suite-Certified-Practitioner-Exam-Study?tab=readme-ov-file) and (https://github.com/DingyShark/BurpSuiteCertifiedPractitioner?tab=readme-ov-file)

So for the exam there are two sites that you have to get access to a user, promote yourself to admin or steal data, then read the contents of the /home/carlos/secret on the system.

Here are my separated points

- Get access to any user
  - XSS
  - DOM-based vulns
  - Authentication
  - Web Cache Poisoning
  - HTTP host header attacks
  - HTTP request smuggling
