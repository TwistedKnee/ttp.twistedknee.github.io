- [ ] testing for creds transported over an encrypted channel - check referrer for whether its HTTP or HTTPS, sending data through HTTP and HTTPS
- [ ] testing for default creds - testing for default creds of common apps, testing for defaults password of new accounts
- [ ] testing for weak lock out mechanism - evaluate the account lockout mechanisms ability to mitigate brute force password guessing, evaluate the unlock mechanisms resistance to unauthorized account unlocking
- [ ] test for bypassing auth schema - force browsing (/admin/main.php, /page.asp?authenticated=yes), parameter modification, session ID prediction, SQL injection
- [ ] test remember password functionality - look for passwords being stored in a cookie, examine the cookies stored in the application, verify that the credentials are not stored in clear text, but are hashed, autocompleted=off?
- [ ] test for browser cache weakness - check browser history issue by clicking 'back' button after logging out, check browser cache issue from HTTP response headers (Cache-Control: no-cache)
- [ ] testing for weak password policy - determine the resistance of the app against brute force password guessing using available password dictionaries by evaluating the length, complexity, reuse and aging requirements of passwords
- [ ] test for weak security question/answer - testing for weak pre-generated questions, testing for weak self-generated questions, testing for brute-forcible answers (unlimited attempts?)
- [ ] test for weak password change or reset functionalities - test password reset (display old password in plain-text?, send via email?, random token on confirmation email?), test password change (need old password?), CSRF vulnerability?
- [ ] test for weaker auth in alternative channel - understand the primary mechanism and identify other channels (mobile app, call center, SSO)
