- [ ] testing for weak SSL/TLS ciphers, insufficient transport layer protection - identify SSL service, identify weak ciphers/protocols (testSSL, sslscan) 
- [ ] testing for padding oracle - compare the responses in three different states - cipher text gets decrypted resulting data is correct, cipher text gets decrypted resulting data is garbled and causes some exception or error handling in the application logic, cipher text decryption fails due to padding errors
- [ ] testing for sensitive information sent via unencrypted channels - check sensitive data during the transmission, information used in authentication (creds, PINs, session identifiers, tokens, cookies), information protected by laws, regulations, or specific organizational policy (PII, Cred cards, customer data)
