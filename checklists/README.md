Start of my checklists for web hacking, I've been lazy and using others or relying on my notes rather then creating an exhaustive list. I would like to add findings from hacktivity I read on bounty forums or research I read as well. 

I will probably rely on the owasp checklist for my start, and link to my methodology.

3. [identity managment testing](/checklists/identity_management_testing)
4. [authentication testing](/checklists/authentication_testing)
5. [authorization testing](/checklists/authorization_testing)
