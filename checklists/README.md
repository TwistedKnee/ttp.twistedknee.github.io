Start of my checklists for web hacking, I've been lazy and using others or relying on my notes rather then creating an exhaustive list. I would like to add findings from hacktivity I read on bounty forums or research I read as well. 

I will probably rely on the owasp checklist for my start, and link to my methodology. 

1. [info_gathering](info_gathering.md)
2. [configuration and deploy management testing](configuration_and_deploy_management_testing)
3. [identity managment testing](identity_management_testing)
4. [authentication testing](authentication_testing)
5. [authorization testing](authorization_testing)
6. [session management testing](session_management_testing)
7. [data validation testing](data_validation_testing)
8. [error handling](error_handling)
9. [cryptography](cryptography)
10. [business logic testing](business_logic_testing)
