Start of my checklists for web hacking, I've been lazy and using others or relying on my notes rather then creating an exhaustive list. I would like to add findings from hacktivity I read on bounty forums or research I read as well. 

I will probably rely on the owasp checklist for my start, and link to my methodology. 

1. info_gathering
2. configuration and deploy management testing
3. identity managmeen testing
4. authentication testing
5. authorization testing
6. session management testing
7. data validation testing
8. error handling
9. cryptography
