- [ ] testing for bypassing session management schema - sessionID analysis prediction, unencrypted cookie transport, brute-force
- [ ] testing for cookies attribute - check HTTPOnly and secure flag, expiration, inspect for sensitive data
- [ ] testing for session fixation - the application doesn't renew the cookie after a successfully user authentication 
- [ ] testing for exposed session variables - encryption & reuse of session tokens vulns, send sessionID with GET method?
- [ ] testing for cross site request forgery - URL analysis, direct access to functions without any token
- [ ] testing for logout functionality - check reuse session after logout both server-side and SSO
- [ ] test session timeout - check session timeout, after the timeout has passed, all session tokens should be destroyed or unusable
- [ ] testing for session puzzling - the application uses the same session variable for more than one purpose, an attacker can potentially access pages in an order unanticipated by the developers so that the session variable is set in one context and then used in another
