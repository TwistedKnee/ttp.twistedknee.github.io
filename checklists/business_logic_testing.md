- [ ] test business logic data validation - looking for data entry points or hand off points between systems or software, once found try to insert logically invalid data into the application/system
- [ ] test ability to forge requests - look for guessable, predictable or hidden functionality of fields, once found try to insert logically valid data into the application/system allowing the user to go through the application/system against the normal business logic workflow
- [ ] test integrity checks - looking for parts of the application/system that move, store or handle data/information (for example, input fields, databases or logs), for each identified component determine what type of data/information is logically acceptable and what types the application/system should guard against, also consider who according to the business logic is allowed to insert, update and delete data/information and in each component, attempt to insert, update or edit delete the data/information values with invalid data/information into each component (input, database, log) by users that should not be allowed per the business logic workflow
- [ ] test for process timing - looking for application/system functionality that may be impacted by time, such as execution time or actions that help users predict a future outcome or allow one to circumvent any part of the business logic or workflow. for example not completing the transactions in an expected time, develop and execute the mis-use cases ensuing that attackers can not gain an advantage based on any timing
- [ ] test number of times a function can be used limits - looking for functions or features in the application that should not be executed more than a single time or specified number of times during the business logic workflow, for each of the functions and features that should only be executed a single time or specified number of times during the business logic workflow, develop abuse/misuse cases that may allow a user to execute more than the allowable number of
- [ ] testing for circumvention of work flows - looking for methods to skip or go to steps in the application process in a different order from the designed/intended business logic flow, for each method develop a misuse case and try to circumvent or perform an action that is "not acceptable" per the business logic workflow
- [ ] test defenses against application misuse - measures that might indicate the application has in-built self defense: changed responses, blocked requests, actions that log a user out or lock their account
- [ ] test upload of unexpected file types - review the project documentation and perform some exploratory testing looking for file types that should be "unsupported" by the application/system, try to upload these unsupported files and verify that it is properly rejected, if multiple files can be uploaded at once, there must be tests in place to verify that each file is properly evaluated, PS file.phtml, shell.phPWND, SHELL~1.PHP
- [ ] test upload of malicious files - develop or acquire a known "malicious" file, try to upload the malicious file to the application/system and verify that it is correctly rejected, if multiple files can be uploaded at once, there must be test in place to verify that each file is properly evaluated
