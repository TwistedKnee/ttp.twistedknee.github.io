# Intro to Web Applications

## Web App Layout

|Category |	Description|
|:--------|:------------|
|Web Application Infrastructure 	|Describes the structure of required components, such as the database, needed for the web application to function as intended. Since the web application can be set up to run on a separate server, it is essential to know which database server it needs to access.|
|Web Application Components 	|The components that make up a web application represent all the components that the web application interacts with. These are divided into the following three areas: UI/UX, Client, and Server components.|
|Web Application Architecture 	|Architecture comprises all the relationships between the various web application components.|

- Client-Server
